					<h3>The Three Musketeers</h3>
					<p>We three came to this place called, Birla Technical Training Institute, Pilani for a three year course of Diploma. Little did we knew that this place would be giving us so much more than that! With the degree of Diploma in CS(which would be given to us soon, as expected..hehe), we have earned friends who may not be with us the whole life, but would be there for us, families created at Hostel, friendships with the locals, learning a lott about this area, surviving in a budget constraint environment, etc. Apart from the fun part, we have gained experiance of a college environment with a superb academic base and an excellent group of faculties at our help. Learning never stopped at a subject or even a topic wheather it was Computer Networks from Niranjan Sir or HTML, CSS & JavaScript from Devjeet Sir, etc. <!--we gained knowledge about C and C++ from Bhawani Ma'am and VB.Net, PHP and MySql from Deepak Sir and everything got combined in the end with Software Engineering from Rajendra Sir with the Cryptography and Network Security from Dashrath Sir.-->
